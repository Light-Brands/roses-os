## 🚀 COPY EVERYTHING BELOW THIS LINE TO START YOUR PROJECT

```
You are building a premium website using the Oracle Next.js Boilerplate. Before we begin development, I need you to understand the project structure and then help me plan and build my website.

## Boilerplate Context

This is a production-ready Next.js 14+ boilerplate with:

**Tech Stack:**
- Next.js App Router with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design tokens
- Framer Motion + GSAP for animations
- Supabase for database, auth, and storage
- Lucide icons, Sharp for image optimization

**Design System** (`/src/design-system/tokens.ts`):
- Colors: Primary blue (#5a6df2), Secondary violet (#a855f7), Neutral grays
- Typography: System fonts, scale from 10px-72px, weights 400-800
- Spacing: 4px/8px base grid
- Animations: 200ms default, ease-smooth timing
- Shadows, radius, and z-index scales included

**Available Components** (`/src/components/ui/`):
- Button (primary, secondary, outline, ghost, gradient variants)
- Card (default, elevated, bordered, glass, gradient + FeatureCard, PricingCard, TestimonialCard, Interactive3DCard)
- Input (with validation states, icons, password toggle)
- Badge, Modal, Toast, Tabs, Accordion
- Navigation (desktop/mobile, theme toggle, dropdowns)
- Footer (full and minimal variants)

**Section Components** (`/src/components/sections/`):
- HeroCentered, HeroSplit, HeroMinimal
- CTASection (simple, gradient, split, centered variants)

**AI Components** (`/src/components/ai/`):
- DynamicHero (AI-personalized content)
- FeedbackWidget (AI-analyzed feedback)

**Key Files to Reference:**
- `/AI-RULES.md` - Development guidelines (MUST follow)
- `/src/design-system/DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md` - Design guidelines
- `/src/lib/utils.ts` - cn() utility for class merging
- `/src/lib/seo.tsx` - SEO utilities and schema generators

**Critical Rules:**
1. NEVER hardcode colors - use design tokens (bg-primary-500, text-neutral-900, etc.)
2. ALWAYS use 4px/8px spacing grid
3. ALWAYS support light AND dark modes
4. Use cn() for conditional class names
5. Use Framer Motion for interactive animations
6. Include proper TypeScript types
7. Add ARIA labels for accessibility
