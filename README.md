# ROSES OS

> The Operating System of Remembrance

ROSES OS is a remembrance ecosystem -- spiritual-modern consciousness technology that restores inner symmetry and coherence. It is not a self-improvement brand. It is an operating system of coherence -- where intuition becomes precise and presence becomes sovereign.

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains the documentation, brand system, and project planning for the ROSES OS ecosystem. It includes the brand DNA, foundational philosophy, program content, teacher training materials, and the project plan for building the ROSES OS web platform.

**Core programs:**

- **The Rose** -- Core inner technology (3 progressive levels) that restores coherence across emotional, mental, and energetic systems
- **The Aura** -- Perception sharpening, relationship work, and leadership empowerment
- **Rose + Aura Combined** -- Integrated learning path
