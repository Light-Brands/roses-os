# ROSES OS -- Project Plan for Designer

> Everything the designer needs to understand, reference, and deliver.

---

## 1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

ROSES OS is a spiritual-modern consciousness technology brand. The design work spans two presentation decks, PDF and web forms, and a website -- all rooted in one unified visual identity system.

**Brand philosophy:** "Apple-level minimalism inside a temple." Sacred-tech minimalism -- earthy, grounded, warm, and quiet. Never loud, never busy, never hype-driven.

**Key reference documents (in this repo):**

| Document | Path | What it contains |
|---|---|---|
| Brand DNA (master bible) | `docs/brand/brand-dna.md` | Complete brand identity, visual system, color palette, typography, design book, web guidelines |
| Brand Identity (summary) | `docs/brand/brand-identity.md` | Condensed brand essence, colors, fonts, UI components, sitemap |
| Visual Aid Manual Plan | `docs/plan-mdr.md` | Structure, scope, and brand rules for the Teacher Visual Aid Manual |
| Invitation Presentation | `docs/program/presentation.md` | Full content for the public-facing invitation deck |
| Training Manual | `docs/training/mdr-teachers-training-manual.md` | Teaching content for Levels 1-3 (source material for the visual aid deck) |
| Source Files | `docs/source-materials/` | Original Keynote presentation and brand guideline document |

## 2. WHAT NEEDS TO BE DESIGNED

There are **five deliverables**, in priority order:

### Deliverable A -- Teacher Visual Aid Manual (Slide Deck / PDF)

**What it is:** A visual reference deck that teachers use while guiding live sessions. Not a student workbook -- a facilitator's visual companion.

**Purpose:**
- Support teachers in explaining energetic concepts clearly
- Provide consistent visual references across all facilitators
- Reduce cognitive load during live teaching

**Content structure (5 sections):**

1. **Introduction** -- Purpose of Rose Meditation, how to use the manual, teaching posture, safety and consent
2. **Energetic Foundations** -- Grounding Cord, Golden Sun, Earth & Cosmos Circuits, The Rose (roots/stem/bloom), The Aura (7 layers), Roses of Protection
3. **Chakras 1-7** (the core section) -- One consistent layout per chakra, each containing:
   - Name (English + Sanskrit)
   - Body location
   - Color, element
   - Core statement (I AM, I FEEL, I CAN, I LOVE, I SPEAK & I LISTEN, I SEE, I KNOW)
   - Focus, balanced/unbalanced expression, primary blockages
   - Teaching cues
4. **Level-specific teaching flows** -- Level 1 (foundations), Level 2 (sacred space + chakra activation), Level 3 (the Analyzer + advanced perception)
5. **Teaching Agreements** -- Core agreements and sacred use guidelines

**Chakra reference table:**

| # | Chakra | Sanskrit | Statement | Color | Element |
|---|--------|----------|-----------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Root | Muladhara | I AM | Red | Earth |
| 2 | Sacral | Svadhisthana | I FEEL | Orange | Water |
| 3 | Solar Plexus | Manipura | I CAN | Yellow | Fire |
| 4 | Heart | Anahata | I LOVE | Green/Pink | Air |
| 5 | Throat | Vishuddha | I SPEAK & I LISTEN | Light Blue | Ether |
| 6 | Third Eye | Ajna | I SEE | Indigo | Light |
| 7 | Crown | Sahasrara | I KNOW | Violet/White | Consciousness |

**Design rules specific to this deck:**
- Non-chakra slides use the warm neutral background (rose clay / peachy neutral)
- Each chakra slide uses its correct chakra color as the dominant color
- Harmonize saturation across chakra slides so the deck feels cohesive
- Gold accents for headings, dividers, key phrases -- used intentionally, never decoratively
- Some existing Procreate diagrams may need to be digitally redrawn or strengthened
- Illustrations needed: seated meditation posture, grounding cord, golden sun, aura layers, chakra body placements, the rose (roots/stem/bloom), roses of protection, the Analyzer

**Final format:** PDF (password-protected, password: 4444), downloadable, usable offline. Designed so it can later be integrated into a web portal or app.

---

### Deliverable B -- Invitation Presentation (Public-Facing Deck)

**What it is:** The outward-facing presentation that introduces The Rose and Aura to prospective participants. A threshold, not a sales pitch.

**Full content is in:** `docs/program/presentation.md`

**Slide flow:**

1. **Title** -- "ROSES OS -- A Seamless Path to Inner Freedom"
2. **The Invitation** -- Einstein quote, the need for new inner tools
3. **Welcome to the Rose** -- What it restores; "When the Rose awakens, Genius awakens"
4. **What the Rose Is** -- Three-point simplicity (awareness, coherence, real choice)
5. **The Two Questions** -- Awareness + coherence
6. **Who This Is For** -- Founders, creators, parents, healers, leaders
7. **You Feel It** -- Poetic quote spread (full-width, presence-oriented)
8. **What You Will Experience** -- The Rose / Aura / Human Journey
9. **What This Journey Awakens** -- Intuition / Leadership / Highest Potential
10. **The Frequency** -- "A frequency you cultivate"
11. **Your Path** -- Option 1 (The Rose), +Aura 1, contribution model table
12. **The Guardians** -- Individual slides for Angelina, Diego, Dara, Peggy (photos framed with white border, `#FFFFFF`, 4-6px)
13. **Begin** -- "Start your journey. Welcome home."

**Design rules specific to this deck:**
- Generous whitespace -- every slide should breathe
- Quote spreads are full-width, silent, centered
- Guardian photos framed with clean white borders for reverent separation from background
- Contribution table should feel inviting, not transactional
- Tone: a quiet invitation, not a sales deck

---

### Deliverable C -- PDF Forms (Fillable, Branded)

**What they are:** A set of fillable PDF documents that participants, teachers, and applicants use throughout the enrollment and teaching journey. These must feel like a seamless extension of the brand -- warm, minimal, and sacred.

**Forms needed:**

#### 1. Enrollment / Registration Form
- Full name, email, phone, location
- How they heard about ROSES OS
- Which program they are enrolling in (The Rose / +Aura 1)
- Income range selection (for contribution tier)
- Emergency contact (optional)

#### 2. Contribution Selection Form
- Program selected
- Income tier declaration (Under $30K / $30K-$70K / Above $70K)
- Chosen contribution amount
- Payment method preference
- Space for personal note (optional)

#### 3. Participant Agreements Form
- Core agreements acknowledgment (punctuality, confidentiality, co-responsibility, trust, patience, empathy, compassion)
- Sacred use agreement -- material is for initiated students only, not to be shared or used to teach independently
- Exception acknowledgment (supporting children under care)
- Signature and date fields

**Design rules for PDF forms:**
- Aura White (`#F7F5F2`) background -- clean, warm, not stark white
- Rose Clay Mauve (`#9C6F6E`) for section headers and dividers
- Antique Olive Brass (`#9E956B`) for form field borders and accent lines
- Cormorant Garamond for section titles, Inter for field labels and body text
- Generous spacing between fields -- forms should breathe, not feel crowded
- Fillable fields with subtle warm-toned backgrounds (Golden Ether `#F5E8E2` or Neutral Sand `#E4DED8`)
- ROSES OS wordmark and subtle brand texture on each page
- Tone: inviting and respectful, never bureaucratic. These are thresholds, not paperwork.

**Final format:** Fillable PDF (Adobe Acrobat / PDF form standard), plus editable source files.

---

### Deliverable D -- Web Forms (Online, Interactive)

**What they are:** The web-based equivalents of the PDF forms, designed for the ROSES OS website. These are the primary touchpoint where someone transitions from visitor to participant. They must feel like a continuation of the brand experience -- a sacred threshold, not a checkout flow.

**Forms needed:**

#### 1. Begin Your Journey (Enrollment)
- Multi-step flow, not a single long page
- Step 1: Who you are (name, email, location)
- Step 2: Your path (program selection with brief descriptions)
- Step 3: Contribution (income tier selection with the brand's invitational language, not price tags)
- Step 4: Agreements (acknowledgment of core agreements and sacred use)
- Step 5: Confirmation ("Welcome home." -- warm confirmation with next steps)

#### 2. Contact / Inquiry Form
- Name, email
- Nature of inquiry (dropdown: General, Programs, Guardians, Collaboration)
- Message field
- Simple, minimal -- no CAPTCHA clutter if avoidable

#### 3. Community Interest / Waitlist
- Name, email
- Location / language
- What draws them to the work (optional, open text)
- Used for future programs and regional expansions

**Design rules for web forms:**
- Follow all website UI component specs (pill-shaped buttons, 20px border radius cards, etc.)
- Multi-step forms use a subtle progress indicator -- minimal, not a numbered stepper
- Field styling: warm-toned backgrounds (Golden Ether or Neutral Sand), soft borders in Muted Clay (`#9A8F88`)
- Active/focused fields: border shifts to Antique Olive Brass (`#9E956B`)
- Submit buttons: pill-shaped, olive gold, with calm invitational labels ("Continue," "Begin," "Submit with Gratitude")
- Error states: gentle, never alarming -- warm language ("This field needs your attention") with Light Terracotta (`#C4836C`) as the indicator color, not red
- Success states: Rose Clay Mauve confirmation with a breathing moment before redirect
- Mobile-first responsive design -- many participants will access from phones
- Accessibility: WCAG 2.1 AA compliant (contrast ratios, keyboard navigation, screen reader labels)
- No dark patterns, no urgency indicators, no countdown timers

**Contribution tier selection (special component):**
- Three cards side by side (stacked on mobile)
- Each card shows the income range and invitational description from the contribution model
- Selected card gets a subtle Rose Clay Mauve border glow
- No "best value" badges or pricing psychology -- this is devotion, not commerce

**Final format:** Figma designs (or equivalent) with component specs, interaction states (default, hover, focus, error, success), and responsive breakpoints. Developer-ready with spacing tokens and color references.

### Deliverable E -- Website

**What it is:** The ROSES OS website -- "a threshold, not a marketing site."

**Sitemap:**

1. **Home** -- Entry point, brand essence
2. **The Rose** -- Core technology (Levels 1-3)
3. **The Aura** -- Perception and relationship work
4. **The Journey** -- What participants experience
5. **The Guardians** -- Facilitators and lineage
6. **Begin** -- Enrollment and contribution model
7. **Journal / Library** -- Content and resources (later phase)

**UI component specs:**
- Buttons: pill-shaped, olive gold accent (`#9E956B`), calm and inviting
- Cards: soft stone feel, 20px border radius, subtle tactile presence
- Navigation: minimal, disappearing on scroll, unobtrusive
- Hero sections: full-width, breathing space, centered typography
- Spacing: generous whitespace throughout -- every element has room to breathe

**Note:** The Teacher Visual Aid Manual acts as a proof of concept for the website and app. Design coherence established in Deliverables A and B should carry directly into the website.

---

## 3. VISUAL IDENTITY SYSTEM

The designer must follow this system across all deliverables.

### Color Palette

#### Primary Colors (Warm, Earthy, Gender-Neutral)

| Color | HEX | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Rose Clay Mauve** | `#9C6F6E` | THE signature color -- field color, not accent. The "human interface layer" of ROSES OS |
| Warm Rose-Clay Brown | `#9B6A66` to `#9E6F6B` | Dusty mauve tones, supporting warmth |
| Light Terracotta | `#C4836C` to `#CB8E7E` | Sun-warmed clay accents, grounding and luminous |

#### Secondary / Neutral Colors

| Color | HEX | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Muted Clay | `#9A8F88` | Warm neutral |
| Balanced Stone | `#BFB3AA` | Background support |
| Neutral Sand | `#E4DED8` | Light background |
| Golden Ether | `#F5E8E2` | Warm blush background, pairs with gold |
| Aura White | `#F7F5F2` | Primary background |
| Soft Charcoal | `#3F3E3C` | Text, dark elements |

#### Accent

| Color | HEX | Role |
|---|---|---|
| **Antique Olive Brass** | `#9E956B` | Accent, buttons, highlights -- "like gold in a temple" |

**Rules:**
- No bright colors
- No harsh contrasts
- Gold is used intentionally, never decoratively
- Chakra slides are the only exception where vivid color is used (each chakra's true color)

### Typography

| Use | Typeface | Character |
|---|---|---|
| Headlines | **Cormorant Garamond** | Elegant, serif, devotional, timeless |
| Body text | **Inter** | Clean, modern, readable, tech-quiet |

**Hierarchy:** Titles > Subtitles > Body > Callouts -- consistent across all deliverables.

### Texture & Visual Language

- Clay, linen, stone, paper, soft fogged light
- Soft gradients, subtle particle or light textures
- Calm, grounded, sacred-tech feel
- No overly busy visuals
- Centered, calm, devotional layouts

### Imagery Style

- Warm, reverent photography for guardian portraits
- Energetic diagrams: clean, minimal, precise
- Illustrations should feel hand-touched but refined (not clinical, not messy)
- Body/anatomy references should be anatomically grounded but energetically expressive

## 5. DESIGN PRINCIPLES -- THE NON-NEGOTIABLES

These principles must guide every design decision:

1. **Silence is sacred** -- Whitespace is not empty. It is intentional breathing room.
2. **Warmth over polish** -- The brand should feel like clay, not chrome.
3. **Centered and calm** -- Layouts are devotional, not dynamic. Centered, not asymmetric.
4. **Gold is earned** -- Use `#9E956B` for emphasis, never decoration.
5. **No hype** -- Nothing should feel urgent, loud, or sales-driven. This is an invitation, not a pitch.
6. **Consistency is coherence** -- Same background style, same layout logic, same color rules, same iconography style across every slide and page.
7. **Texture has meaning** -- Clay, linen, stone, paper evoke earthiness and groundedness. Use them with intention.
8. **The Rose Clay Mauve (`#9C6F6E`) is the brand** -- It is the field, not the accent. It should feel like home.

---

## 6. VOICE & TONE REFERENCE (FOR COPY ON SLIDES)

The designer should understand the language world they are designing for:

- **Simplicity** -- Clear, unadorned
- **Reverence** -- Sacred without being religious
- **Clarity** -- Precise, never vague
- **Spaciousness** -- Room to breathe in every message
- **Calm authority** -- Grounded, never forceful

**Key phrases that appear across materials:**
- "The Operating System of Remembrance"
- "When the Rose awakens, Genius awakens"
- "Not techniques, but instruments of consciousness"
- "You are the mountain, not the summit"
- "This is not learning. This is remembering."
- "Welcome home."

## 7. FILE DELIVERY EXPECTATIONS

| Deliverable | Format | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Teacher Visual Aid Manual | PDF + editable source (Figma/Keynote/InDesign) | Password-protected PDF (4444). Designed for future app/web integration |
| Invitation Presentation | PDF + editable source | Optimized for screen sharing and live presentation |
| PDF Forms | Fillable PDF + editable source | Tested across Acrobat, Preview, and browser PDF readers |
| Web Forms | Figma (or equivalent) | All interaction states, responsive breakpoints, developer-ready specs |
| Website | Figma (or equivalent) | Component-based, responsive, with design tokens |
| Assets | SVG/PNG | All illustrations, icons, textures exported as reusable assets |

---

## 8. LANGUAGE VERSIONS REQUIRED

**Phase 1 languages:**
1. English (primary)
2. Portuguese (secondary)
3. Spanish

All versions (decks, PDF forms, and web forms) must maintain identical layouts with text-only swaps. Translations should respect linguistic nuance -- not be literal word-for-word translations.

---

## 9. STRATEGIC CONTEXT

This work is more than design production. The Teacher Visual Aid Manual is a proof of concept that demonstrates:

- Design coherence
- Educational clarity
- Energetic intelligence
- Platform readiness

It shows: *"This is how we think, teach, and build."*

The designer is building the visual foundation for an entire ecosystem -- presentations, forms, website, and eventually an app. Every decision made now carries forward.
