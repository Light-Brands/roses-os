## History

Aura Reading emerged in the 1960s, in California, channeled by a North American called **Lewis Bostwick**. Founder of the **Berkeley Psychic Institute** and the **Church of the Divine Man**, he channeled and systematized the techniques and tools sent by the angels, to assist in the process of evolution of humanity.

### Lineage

# LEVEL 1

---

## The Rose

The Rose is the foundational symbol and tool of this practice -- a living energetic instrument used throughout all levels of the work.

---

## Posture

Proper meditation posture is seated upright in a chair. Feet are flat on the floor, hands resting gently on the thighs or knees, spine upright, eyes closed. The body is relaxed yet alert -- grounded and receptive.

*[Visual reference: Person seated comfortably in a chair, spine straight, feet flat, hands on knees, eyes closed]*

---

## Grounding Cord

The grounding cord is an energetic connection that extends from the base of the spine (first chakra) downward into the center of the Earth. It anchors your energy body to the planet, providing stability, safety, and a channel for releasing unwanted energy.

*[Visual reference: Person seated with a beam of light/energy extending from the base of the spine down through the floor into the earth, with ripples at the contact point]*

---

## Golden Sun

The Golden Sun is a tool for replenishing and restoring your own energy. Visualize a radiant golden sun above your head. It calls back your own life-force energy from wherever you may have left it -- in people, places, situations, or time. It fills you with your own highest vibration.

*[Visual reference: Person seated in meditation with a bright golden sun positioned directly above the head, radiating light downward into the body]*

---

## An Exercise to Feel Your Aura

The aura is the energetic field that surrounds your physical body. This exercise helps you become aware of its presence, its edges, and its quality. The aura consists of multiple layers radiating outward from the body.

*[Visual reference: Golden silhouette of a human figure surrounded by concentric layers of glowing energy]*

---

## Grounding Cord (with Aura)

Once you are aware of your aura, the grounding cord practice deepens. You ground not only the physical body but also the aura itself -- allowing the entire energy field to anchor into the Earth.

*[Visual reference: Person seated within a visible aura egg, grounding cord extending from base of spine through the aura boundary and into the earth]*

---

## Full Meditation Setup

The complete foundational setup combines all three elements: the person is seated in proper posture, enclosed within their aura, with the grounding cord descending into the earth and the golden sun shining above the crown.

*[Visual reference: Person seated within the aura egg, grounding cord below, golden sun above -- the full energetic architecture in place]*

---

## Circuit of the Energy of the Earth

The Earth circuit is an energetic pathway that draws the energy of the Earth upward through the feet, rising through the legs and into the body. This circuit connects you to the grounding, nourishing, stabilizing force of the planet.

*[Visual reference: Person seated with glowing energy points along the feet, legs, and lower body -- golden light rising upward from the earth through the soles of the feet]*

---

## Circuit of the Energy of the Cosmos

The Cosmic circuit is an energetic pathway that draws cosmic energy downward through the crown of the head (7th chakra) and into the body. This circuit connects you to the higher frequencies of universal consciousness, inspiration, and spiritual guidance.

*[Visual reference: Person seated with concentric rings of energy spiraling above the head, channeling downward through the crown and into the body]*

---

## Circuit of Energy of Cosmos and Earth

When both circuits are activated simultaneously, the energies of the Earth and Cosmos flow together through the body. Earth energy rises from below; Cosmic energy descends from above. They meet and blend within the body, creating a unified field of balanced, integrated energy.

*[Visual reference: Person seated with both circuits active -- Earth energy flowing up through legs, Cosmic energy flowing down through crown, with the full aura and grounding cord visible]*

---

## The Rose (as Energetic Tool)

The Rose is used as a living energetic instrument throughout the practice. It has roots (connection to source), a stem (channel of energy), and a bloom (the active, radiant tool). The Rose can be placed, moved, opened, closed, and released according to the needs of the meditation.

*[Visual reference: A golden rose with visible roots, long stem, and open bloom]*

---

## Roses of Protection, Observation and Separation

Roses are placed at the edges of the aura to serve as energetic sentinels. They perform three functions:

1. **Protection** -- They define and guard the boundary of your aura
2. **Observation** -- They help you notice what energies are approaching or interacting with your field
3. **Separation** -- They create healthy energetic distinction between your energy and the energy of others

*[Visual reference: Person seated within aura, with roses placed at the four corners/edges of the aura boundary, connected by lines forming a protective perimeter]*

---

## Cleansing Rose

The Cleansing Rose is placed outside of the aura. It is used to absorb and transmute foreign or stagnant energy from within your field. Energy that does not belong to you -- from other people, environments, or experiences -- is drawn out of the aura and into the Cleansing Rose, where it is neutralized.

*[Visual reference: Person seated within aura with grounding cord, a golden rose positioned outside the aura boundary absorbing energy]*

---

## Energy Recovery of Each Chakra

After cleansing, the Rose is used to recover your own energy that has been left in or taken by others. The Rose is sent out as an instrument to gather and return your own life-force energy to each chakra, restoring fullness and sovereignty to each energy center.

*[Visual reference: Person seated within aura, with a glowing rose on a cord extending outward -- gathering energy and bringing it back to the chakra system]*

---

## Discharge Excess Energy

After deep meditation or energy work, excess energy may accumulate in the body. To discharge it, lean forward from the seated position with hands reaching toward the ground. Allow the excess energy to flow out through the hands and into the earth, returning the body to a calm, balanced state.

*[Visual reference: Person leaning forward from chair, hands reaching toward floor, golden energy streaming from hands into the earth]*

---

# LEVEL 2

---

## Let's Create Your Sacred Space

Level 2 begins with creating your own sacred space -- an internal energetic environment that serves as your meditation home. This is the space from which all deeper work is conducted.

---

## The 6th and 7th Chakras

Understanding the locations and roles of the upper chakras is essential for Level 2 work:

- **6th Chakra (Third Eye)** -- Located at the center of the forehead, between and slightly above the eyebrows
- **7th Chakra (Crown)** -- Located at the top of the head

*[Visual reference: Side profile of a head showing the precise locations of the 6th chakra (forehead center) and 7th chakra (crown of head)]*

---

## Let's Prepare Your Physical Space

Before meditation, prepare your physical environment to support the energetic work. The external space should mirror the internal intention: clean, clear, quiet, and intentionally held.

---

## Protection of the Space

The physical meditation space is protected by creating an energetic grid using roses. Golden roses are placed at the four corners (and above/below) of the space, connected by lines of golden energy forming a sacred geometric structure -- a container for the work.

*[Visual reference: Person seated at the center of a golden geometric grid structure with roses at each of the four upper corners and four lower corners, connected by golden lines forming a cube-like framework]*

---

## Cleansing of the Space

Once the space is protected, it is cleansed. A large Cleansing Rose is placed above the grid, and golden energy pours downward through the entire structure, clearing all foreign, stagnant, or disruptive energies from the space.

*[Visual reference: Person seated within the rose grid, with a large open rose above the structure pouring golden light downward through the grid, cleansing the entire space]*

---

## Owning Your Space

After protection and cleansing, you claim ownership of the space. This is an act of energetic sovereignty -- declaring the space as yours, filling it with your own energy and intention. The space becomes an extension of your aura and your practice.

*[Visual reference: Person seated within the fully activated rose grid structure, radiating energy from within, filling the grid with their own light]*

## Let's Talk About Chakras

The chakra system is the energetic anatomy of the human body. There are seven primary chakras, each governing specific aspects of physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual life.

## Cleansing of Each Aura Layer

The aura is composed of seven layers, each corresponding to a chakra. In Level 2, each layer is individually cleansed from the outermost to the innermost:

| Layer | Aura Layer |
|-------|-----------|
| 7 | 7th Aura layer |
| 6 | 6th Aura layer |
| 5 | 5th Aura layer |
| 4 | 4th Aura layer |
| 3 | 3rd Aura layer |
| 2 | 2nd Aura layer |
| 1 | 1st Aura layer |

*[Visual reference: Person seated in meditation with seven distinct color-coded aura layers visible, golden sun above, grounding cord below -- each layer corresponding to a chakra color]*

---

## Cleansing of Each Chakra

Each individual chakra is cleansed using roses. The roses address two dimensions:

- **Dynamics of the Past** -- Energetic patterns, imprints, and blockages carried from past experiences
- **Dynamics of the Present** -- Current energetic influences, relationships, and situations affecting the chakra

*[Visual reference: Person seated within aura, with roses placed on either side -- one rose for the past, one rose for the present -- drawing out and transmuting energy from each chakra]*

---

## Energy Recovery of Each Chakra (Level 2)

After cleansing, the energy recovery process is repeated at a deeper level. The Rose is sent out to gather and return your own energy to each individual chakra, restoring sovereignty, vitality, and wholeness to each energy center.

*[Visual reference: Person seated within golden aura, with a rose on a cord extending outward to collect and return energy]*

---

## Golden Sticky Roses

Golden Sticky Roses are a powerful cleansing and recovery technique. Small golden roses are placed directly on and within the body at specific locations to draw out deeply embedded foreign energy and restore your own.

### Phase 1 -- Chakra Placement

Golden sticky roses are placed on each of the seven chakras, drawing out foreign energy lodged in the energy centers.

*[Visual reference: Person seated with golden roses placed on each chakra point -- crown, third eye, throat, heart, solar plexus, sacral, root -- with grounding cord and golden rings above]*

### Phase 2 -- Body Placement

Golden sticky roses are placed at the joints and extremities of the body -- shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, hips, knees, ankles, feet -- drawing out foreign energy stored in the physical body.

*[Visual reference: Person seated with golden roses placed at every major joint and extremity of the body]*

### Phase 3 -- Full Body Coverage

Golden sticky roses are placed throughout the entire body -- covering the torso, limbs, and all remaining areas -- for a thorough, complete energetic cleansing.

*[Visual reference: Person seated covered in golden roses from head to toe, with grounding cord and golden rings above]*

### Phase 4 -- Integration

After the golden sticky roses have done their work, a large Golden Rose appears above the head. All foreign energy gathered by the sticky roses is released, and the entire body is bathed in golden light -- restoring, sealing, and integrating the energy body.

*[Visual reference: Person seated with a large golden rose blooming above the head, golden light cascading down through the entire body, all sticky roses dissolved into light]*

# LEVEL 3

## Analyzer

The Analyzer is an advanced tool introduced in Level 3. It is an energetic point located at the back of the head, at the base of the skull (the occipital ridge / brainstem area). The Analyzer is used for deeper perception, reading, and discernment of energy -- a tool for precise energetic analysis.

*[Visual reference: View from behind the head showing a glowing golden point of light at the back of the head/upper neck area, with energy channels extending downward -- the Analyzer point]*
