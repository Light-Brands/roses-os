# PART I -- BRAND IDENTITY

---

## Brand Essence

**Brand Name:** ROSES OS

**Brand Definition:** ROSES OS is not a self-improvement brand. It is a remembrance ecosystem. A system designed to restore coherence, inner symmetry, and presence in modern life.

> "Not as belief. As remembrance."
> "This is not learning. This is remembering."

ROSES OS exists to dissolve distortion and return people to truth.

**Core Promise:** A seamless path to:

- Inner freedom
- Coherence
- Awakened leadership
- Conscious prosperity
- Intuitive clarity

**Brand Statement:** ROSES OS is the operating system of coherence -- where intuition becomes precise and presence becomes sovereign.

**Brand Feeling:** ROSES OS should always feel like:

- Warm silence
- Sacred minimalism
- Calm authority
- Modern devotion
- Quiet genius awakening

---

## Mission & Vision

**Mission:** To restore inner symmetry and coherence through simple, precise instruments of consciousness. ROSES OS is built for this moment -- where life moves fast and noise is constant.

**Vision:** A world where humans live, lead, create, and love from presence instead of distortion. Where life becomes creation instead of reaction.

---

## Origin & Lineage

Aura Reading emerged in the 1960s, in California, channeled by a North American called **Lewis Bostwick**. Founder of the **Berkeley Psychic Institute** and the **Church of the Divine Man**, he channeled and systematized the techniques and tools sent by the angels, to assist in the process of evolution of humanity.

### Lineage Transmission

Berkeley Psychic Institute --> **Anastacia Plunk** --> **Angelina Ataide** --> **ROSES OS**

These teachings are part of a living energetic lineage. They invite inner stillness, gentle discipline, and deep self-responsibility. ROSES OS is not a system to be imposed or taught casually -- it is an energetic operating system revealed through direct practice and transmission.

---

## Audience

### Who This Is For

Adults -- women and men -- especially:

- Founders
- Creators
- Entrepreneurs
- Healers

For those who feel the world accelerating and know the tools they inherited were not built for this moment.

### What They Feel

- The world accelerating
- Inner tools becoming outdated
- A call toward truth, simplicity, and stability

### Audience Desire

They want to move through complexity without losing themselves. They are ready to rise above noise. They are seeking alignment and peace.

---

## The Two Core Questions

The Rose asks two foundational questions:

1. **Are you aware of your inner state at this moment?**
2. **Do you feel coherent inside -- if not, how can you restore it?**

No belief needed. Just honest awareness and presence. When even a trace of coherence returns, clarity grows, and choice becomes real again.

---

# PART II -- THE TECHNOLOGY

---

## The Technology -- What ROSES OS Is

*"Insanity, as Einstein said, is expecting new results while repeating the same actions."*

We are building a future with inner tools from a world that no longer exists. Life now moves faster, louder, and more complex. We need inner tools -- simple, precise, and aligned to this moment.

**The Rose is an alternative.**

The Rose is simple, living inner technology:

- It restores awareness.
- It restores coherence.
- It restores real choice.

It doesn't fight the noise and fragmentation -- it quietly dissolves the conditions that keep chaos alive.

The Rose restores coherence across emotional, mental, and energetic systems -- making intuition precise and presence sovereign. Simple and decentralized, it frees you from endless healing and returns you to natural alignment.

---

## The Rose -- Core Inner Technology

The Rose is the foundational symbol and tool of this practice -- a living energetic instrument used throughout all levels of the work. It has roots (connection to source), a stem (channel of energy), and a bloom (the active, radiant tool). The Rose can be placed, moved, opened, closed, and released according to the needs of the meditation.

**When the Rose awakens, Genius awakens.**

The Rose dissolves distortion and restores coherence. Inner awareness expands, presence and stability deepen. From this state, intuition sharpens, leadership rises, and connection becomes natural.

---

## Level 1 -- Foundational Practices

### Posture

Proper meditation posture is seated upright in a chair. Feet are flat on the floor, hands resting gently on the thighs or knees, spine upright, eyes closed. The body is relaxed yet alert -- grounded and receptive.

### Grounding Cord

The grounding cord is an energetic connection that extends from the base of the spine (first chakra) downward into the center of the Earth. It anchors your energy body to the planet, providing stability, safety, and a channel for releasing unwanted energy.

### Golden Sun

The Golden Sun is a tool for replenishing and restoring your own energy. Visualize a radiant golden sun above your head. It calls back your own life-force energy from wherever you may have left it -- in people, places, situations, or time. It fills you with your own highest vibration.

### Feeling Your Aura

The aura is the energetic field that surrounds your physical body. This exercise helps you become aware of its presence, its edges, and its quality. The aura consists of multiple layers radiating outward from the body.

### Grounding Cord with Aura

Once you are aware of your aura, the grounding cord practice deepens. You ground not only the physical body but also the aura itself -- allowing the entire energy field to anchor into the Earth.

### Full Meditation Setup

The complete foundational setup combines all three elements: the person is seated in proper posture, enclosed within their aura, with the grounding cord descending into the earth and the golden sun shining above the crown.

### Circuit of the Energy of the Earth

The Earth circuit is an energetic pathway that draws the energy of the Earth upward through the feet, rising through the legs and into the body. This circuit connects you to the grounding, nourishing, stabilizing force of the planet.

### Circuit of the Energy of the Cosmos

The Cosmic circuit is an energetic pathway that draws cosmic energy downward through the crown of the head (7th chakra) and into the body. This circuit connects you to the higher frequencies of universal consciousness, inspiration, and spiritual guidance.

### Circuit of Energy of Cosmos and Earth

When both circuits are activated simultaneously, the energies of the Earth and Cosmos flow together through the body. Earth energy rises from below; Cosmic energy descends from above. They meet and blend within the body, creating a unified field of balanced, integrated energy.

### Roses of Protection, Observation and Separation

Roses are placed at the edges of the aura to serve as energetic sentinels:

1. **Protection** -- They define and guard the boundary of your aura
2. **Observation** -- They help you notice what energies are approaching or interacting with your field
3. **Separation** -- They create healthy energetic distinction between your energy and the energy of others

### Cleansing Rose

The Cleansing Rose is placed outside of the aura. It is used to absorb and transmute foreign or stagnant energy from within your field. Energy that does not belong to you -- from other people, environments, or experiences -- is drawn out of the aura and into the Cleansing Rose, where it is neutralized.

### Energy Recovery of Each Chakra

After cleansing, the Rose is used to recover your own energy that has been left in or taken by others. The Rose is sent out as an instrument to gather and return your own life-force energy to each chakra, restoring fullness and sovereignty to each energy center.

### Discharge Excess Energy

After deep meditation or energy work, excess energy may accumulate in the body. To discharge it, lean forward from the seated position with hands reaching toward the ground. Allow the excess energy to flow out through the hands and into the earth, returning the body to a calm, balanced state.

---

## Level 2 -- Sacred Space & Chakra System

### Creating Your Sacred Space

Level 2 begins with creating your own sacred space -- an internal energetic environment that serves as your meditation home. This is the space from which all deeper work is conducted.

### The 6th and 7th Chakras

- **6th Chakra (Third Eye)** -- Located at the center of the forehead, between and slightly above the eyebrows
- **7th Chakra (Crown)** -- Located at the top of the head

### Preparing Your Physical Space

Before meditation, prepare your physical environment to support the energetic work. The external space should mirror the internal intention: clean, clear, quiet, and intentionally held.

### Protection of the Space

The physical meditation space is protected by creating an energetic grid using roses. Golden roses are placed at the four corners (and above/below) of the space, connected by lines of golden energy forming a sacred geometric structure -- a container for the work.

### Cleansing of the Space

Once the space is protected, it is cleansed. A large Cleansing Rose is placed above the grid, and golden energy pours downward through the entire structure, clearing all foreign, stagnant, or disruptive energies from the space.

### Owning Your Space

After protection and cleansing, you claim ownership of the space. This is an act of energetic sovereignty -- declaring the space as yours, filling it with your own energy and intention.

### Cleansing of Each Aura Layer

The aura is composed of seven layers, each corresponding to a chakra. Each layer is individually cleansed from the outermost to the innermost:

| Layer | Aura Layer |
|-------|-----------|
| 7 | 7th Aura layer |
| 6 | 6th Aura layer |
| 5 | 5th Aura layer |
| 4 | 4th Aura layer |
| 3 | 3rd Aura layer |
| 2 | 2nd Aura layer |
| 1 | 1st Aura layer |

### Cleansing of Each Chakra

Each individual chakra is cleansed using roses addressing two dimensions:

- **Dynamics of the Past** -- Energetic patterns, imprints, and blockages carried from past experiences
- **Dynamics of the Present** -- Current energetic influences, relationships, and situations affecting the chakra

### Golden Sticky Roses

Golden Sticky Roses are a powerful cleansing and recovery technique. Small golden roses are placed directly on and within the body at specific locations to draw out deeply embedded foreign energy and restore your own.

**Phase 1 -- Chakra Placement:** Golden sticky roses placed on each of the seven chakras, drawing out foreign energy lodged in the energy centers.

**Phase 2 -- Body Placement:** Golden sticky roses placed at the joints and extremities -- shoulders, elbows, wrists, hands, hips, knees, ankles, feet -- drawing out foreign energy stored in the physical body.

**Phase 3 -- Full Body Coverage:** Golden sticky roses placed throughout the entire body for thorough, complete energetic cleansing.

**Phase 4 -- Integration:** A large Golden Rose appears above the head. All foreign energy gathered by the sticky roses is released, and the entire body is bathed in golden light -- restoring, sealing, and integrating the energy body.

---

## Level 3 -- Advanced Perception

### Analyzer

The Analyzer is an advanced tool introduced in Level 3. It is an energetic point located at the back of the head, at the base of the skull (the occipital ridge / brainstem area). The Analyzer is used for deeper perception, reading, and discernment of energy -- a tool for precise energetic analysis.

---

## The Aura

When heart aligns with soul, you perceive subtle senses and the energy shaping your choices. Each reading is a mirror -- strengthening clarity, relationships, and service.

Aura sharpens perception, revealing what shapes your choices, relationships, and reality.

- **The Rose** awakens perception.
- **Aura** empowers relationship.
- **Together**, they restore coherence, love, and confidence.

---

**No prior experience is needed. Only presence.**

---

---

# PART III -- VISUAL IDENTITY & DESIGN SYSTEM

---

## Visual Identity System

### Visual World

**Earthy Spiritual Modern + Sacred Tech Minimalism**

The design should feel like:

- Stone
- Clay
- Silence
- Breath
- Warmth
- Geometry
- Modern sacredness

### The Elegance-Tech Bridge

- Inter + spacing + restraint = technology
- Cormorant + texture + clay = devotion
- Rose Clay Mauve sits between them

**Rose Clay Mauve is the human interface layer of ROSES OS.** Alive. Calm. Intelligent.

---

## Color Palette

### Primary Signature Color

| Color | HEX | Role |
|-------|-----|------|
| **Rose Clay Mauve** | `#9C6F6E` | The human interface layer -- the signature color of ROSES OS |

Rose Clay Mauve reads as:

- **Earthy** (clay, mineral)
- **Human** (blood / warmth)
- **Calm** (low saturation)
- **Neutral-leaning** (not floral pink)

It is not feminine -- it is biological + geological.

> A warm mineral field color used for moments of reflection, invitation, and remembrance. It represents the human interface of ROSES OS -- where presence meets structure. This color should feel lived-in, not decorative. Always textured. Always quiet.

#### How to Use Rose Clay Mauve

This color should never be used like an accent button color. **It is a field color, not a highlight.**

**Correct Uses:**

- Full-bleed slide backgrounds
- Long-form reading sections
- Quote slides
- "What the Rose Is" / philosophical content
- Invitation pages
- Threshold moments

**Avoid Using It For:**

- CTAs
- Small UI elements
- Icons
- Text highlights
- Navigation text

> Think of it as: The room you enter -- not the object you click.

#### Typography on Rose Clay Mauve Backgrounds

- Headlines: Aura White (`#F7F5F2`) or very light sand
- Body text: Neutral Sand (`#E4DED8`)
- Bold emphasis: Aura White only (no brighter contrast)
- Avoid pure white -- it breaks the warmth

### Primary Warm Tones

| Color | HEX | Description |
|-------|-----|-------------|
| Warm Rose-Clay Brown | `#9B6A66` to `#9E6F6B` | Dusty mauve tones -- clay, terracotta dust, sun-warmed stone |
| Deep Terracotta | `#7A3A34` to `#7F3F39` | Fired clay, iron-rich earth -- solid, embodied, ancient |

### Primary Neutrals (Structural)

| Color | HEX | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Muted Clay | `#9A8F88` | Warm neutral -- more mineral, reads earthy |
| Balanced Stone | `#BFB3AA` | Background support -- cooler, architectural, unisex |
| Neutral Sand | `#E4DED8` | Light background -- linen / parchment feel |
| Aura White | `#F7F5F2` | Primary background -- excellent and neutral |
| Soft Charcoal | `#3F3E3C` | Body text, navigation, buttons, footer, dark elements |

### Accent

| Color | HEX | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Antique Olive Brass | `#9E956B` | Buttons, highlights, sacred detail -- more olive, masculine + feminine balance, grounded, premium, timeless |

> Accent should be rare. Like gold in a temple.

### Palette Goals

- Earthy, grounded, gender-neutral
- Still warm, refined, and modern
- Feels good for men + women + non-binary audiences
- No bright colors. No saturation. Calm only.

---

## Typography

### Font Pairing

| Use | Typeface | Character |
|-----|----------|-----------|
| **Display / Sacred Headlines** | **Cormorant Garamond** | Timeless, devotional, poetic -- sacred elegance |
| **Body / Modern Clarity** | **Inter** | Modern, clean, tech-quiet -- slight tech precision |

### Cormorant Garamond -- Used For

- Hero titles
- Quote spreads
- Section headers

### Inter -- Used For

- Paragraphs
- UI labels
- Navigation
- Buttons

### Type Scale (Web)

| Style | Size | Weight |
|-------|------|--------|
| Hero Title | 64--80px | Light |

### Typography Rules

- Never bold aggressively
- Always increase line-height
- Text should breathe
- No dense blocks
- Large spacing
- Minimal weights
- Breath between lines
- Silence is part of the design

---

## Imagery & Graphics

### Photography Style

- Warm natural light
- Human presence
- Earth textures
- Quiet moments
- Authenticity over polish

Only use imagery that feels: warm, human, earthy, devotional, quiet.

### Graphic Style

- Minimal line icons
- Subtle sacred geometry
- Soft gradients
- Spacious compositions

### Logo System

**Primary Logo:** Minimal line rose icon only (no leaves, no botanical detail)

**Logo Feel:** Timeless, sacred, modern, neutral, precise

**Logo Rules:**

- Always centered or intentional
- Never stretched
- Never shadowed
- Never decorated
- Always surrounded by space

### Avoid

- Neon spirituality
- Stock wellness cliches
- Overly corporate tech visuals
- Loud smiling stock photos

---

## Design Book

### Atmosphere

ROSES OS is the feeling of:

- Walking into stillness
- Remembering your center
- Warmth without noise
- Intelligence without performance

**Design is not decoration. Design is coherence.**

### Texture Language

Primary surfaces feel like:

- Clay
- Linen
- Stone
- Paper
- Soft fogged light

**Everything should feel touched by earth.**

#### Texture Guidance (Critical)

Rose Clay Mauve should always be paired with subtle texture (linen, paper grain, soft mineral noise). Flat fills make it feel cosmetic. Texture makes it architectural.

This keeps it:

- Grounded
- Tactile
- Non-glam
- Non-beauty-brand

### Layout Philosophy

ROSES OS layouts are:

- Centered
- Quiet
- Minimal
- Devotional
- Balanced

**Whitespace is sacred space.**

### Sacred-Tech Blend

ROSES OS is where:

- Spirituality meets structure
- Mysticism meets clarity
- Soul meets system
- Inner tools meet modern life

> Think: Apple-level minimalism inside a temple.

### Design Keywords

- Calm luxury
- Sacred simplicity
- Quiet futurism
- Inner symmetry
- Devotion
- Breath + space
- Grounded elegance

### Application Examples

ROSES OS design should translate into:

- Invitations
- Retreats
- Journals
- Digital portals
- Course platforms
- Membership ecosystems
- Modern sacred interfaces

### Final Brand Truth

ROSES OS is not something you follow. It is something you return to. It does not ask for belief. It asks for presence.

**Welcome home.**

---

# PART IV -- WEBSITE & DIGITAL EXPERIENCE

---

## Website Style Guide

### Website Purpose

The ROSES OS website is not a marketing site. **It is a threshold.**

A visitor should feel:

- Calm
- Seen
- Invited
- Oriented
- Quietly awakened

The site is not trying to convince. It is remembering.

### Design Principles (Non-Negotiable)

**Principle 1 -- Silence is the Brand**
Whitespace is not empty. Whitespace is presence.

**Principle 2 -- Calm Authority**
No urgency. No loud sales tone. Only clarity.

**Principle 3 -- Sacred-Tech Simplicity**
Modern UI precision + earth-toned devotion.

**Principle 4 -- Invitation, Not Promotion**
Every section should feel like: "You are welcome here."

### Spacing + Layout System

**Grid Feel:** ROSES OS is centered and spacious.

- Max width: 1100px
- Wide padding: 96px+ on desktop
- Generous vertical rhythm

**Section Spacing:**

| Element | Spacing |
|---------|---------|
| Between sections | 120--160px |
| Title to body | 24--32px |
| Paragraph spacing | 16--20px |

**The site should feel like walking slowly.**

### Interaction + Motion

Motion should feel like breath.

**Animations:**

- Fade in
- Slow scroll reveals
- Gentle hover warmth

**Never:**

- Bouncing
- Spinning
- Flashy transitions

### Hero Section

The hero is not promotional. It is a remembering.

- Subtext (Inter): Where inner symmetry becomes the source of leadership, creativity, and conscious prosperity.
- Single CTA Button: Start Your Journey

**Hero Visual Style:**

- Solid rose clay background OR soft textured field
- Minimal rose icon centered
- Nothing busy

### Section Templates

**Quote Spread Section:** Full-width. Silence. Centered text: *"When coherence returns, Genius awakens."* No button. Just presence.

**The Journey Section:** Three pillars layout -- The Rose, The Aura, The Human Journey. Each as calm cards, not sales blocks.

**Guardians Section:** Photography should feel real, reverent. Photo + Name + 2-line essence. No long resumes.

**Pricing / Contribution Section:** Must feel sacred, not transactional. Language: "A contribution rooted in truth." No "BUY NOW."

## Copy Style Rules

ROSES OS copy must always feel like:

- A doorway
- A remembering
- A calm truth

### Rules

- Short sentences
- Poetic clarity over clever copy
- Questions over statements when inviting engagement
- Present tense, active voice

### Never say:

- "Buy this course"
- "Limited time offer"
- "Crush your goals"

### Always say:

- "The way is open."
- "Return to coherence."
- "This is remembrance."
- "Welcome home."
