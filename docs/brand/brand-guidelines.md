---

## Visual Identity System

### Visual World

**Earthy Spiritual Modern + Sacred Tech Minimalism**

The design should feel like:

- Stone
- Clay
- Silence
- Breath
- Warmth
- Geometry
- Modern sacredness

---

## Logo System

### Primary Logo

Minimal line rose icon only (no leaves, no botanical detail).

### Logo Feel

- Timeless
- Sacred
- Modern
- Neutral
- Precise

### Logo Rules

- Always centered or intentional
- Never stretched
- Never shadowed
- Never decorated
- Always surrounded by space

---

## Color Palette

### Palette Goals

- Earthy, grounded, gender-neutral
- Still warm, refined, and modern
- Feels good for men + women + non-binary audiences
- No bright colors. No saturation. Calm only.

### Primary Neutrals (Structural)

| Color | HEX | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Muted Clay | `#9A8F88` | Same warmth, more mineral, reads earthy |
| Balanced Stone | `#BFB3AA` | Cooler, architectural, unisex |
| Neutral Sand | `#E4DED8` | More linen / parchment feel |
| Aura White | `#F7F5F2` | Excellent and neutral |
| Soft Charcoal | `#3F3E3C` | Body text, navigation, buttons, footer |

### Secondary Foundation (Atmospheric)

| Color | HEX | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Rose Clay Mauve | `#9C6F6E` | Human interface layer of ROSES OS |

### Accent

| Color | HEX | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Antique Olive Brass | `#9E956B` | Buttons, highlights, sacred detail |

> Accent should be rare. Like gold in a temple.

### Rose Clay Mauve -- Signature Color

**HEX:** `#9C6F6E`

Rose Clay Mauve reads as:

- **Earthy** (clay, mineral)
- **Human** (blood / warmth)
- **Calm** (low saturation)
- **Neutral-leaning** (not floral pink)

It is not feminine -- it is biological + geological.

> A warm mineral field color used for moments of reflection, invitation, and remembrance. It represents the human interface of ROSES OS -- where presence meets structure. This color should feel lived-in, not decorative. Always textured. Always quiet.

#### How to Use Rose Clay Mauve

This color should never be used like an accent button color. **It is a field color, not a highlight.**

**Correct Uses:**

- Full-bleed slide backgrounds
- Long-form reading sections
- Quote slides
- Philosophical content ("What the Rose Is")
- Invitation pages
- Threshold moments

**Avoid Using It For:**

- CTAs
- Small UI elements
- Icons
- Text highlights
- Navigation text

> Think of it as: The room you enter -- not the object you click.

#### Typography on Rose Clay Mauve Backgrounds

- Headlines: Aura White (`#F7F5F2`) or very light sand
- Body text: Neutral Sand (`#E4DED8`)
- Bold emphasis: Aura White only (no brighter contrast)
- Avoid pure white -- it breaks the warmth

#### Texture Guidance

Rose Clay Mauve should always be paired with subtle texture (linen, paper grain, soft mineral noise). Flat fills make it feel cosmetic. Texture makes it architectural.

This keeps it:

- Grounded
- Tactile
- Non-glam
- Non-beauty-brand

### Deep Terracotta -- Architectural Tone

**HEX:** `#7A3A34` to `#7F3F39`

| Attribute | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| RGB | ~122--127, 58--63, 52--57 |
| HSL | Hue ~6--10 degrees (red-earth), low-moderate saturation, low-mid lightness |
| Feel | Fired clay, iron-rich earth, terracotta tile |
| Temperature | Warm, grounded, weighty |
| Energy | Solid, embodied, ancient rather than romantic |

This tone reads differently than mauve -- much less violet, more iron/oxide than rose. Feels architectural and elemental.

### The Elegance-Tech Bridge

- Inter + spacing + restraint = technology
- Cormorant + texture + clay = devotion
- Rose Clay Mauve sits between them

This color becomes the human interface layer of ROSES OS. Alive. Calm. Intelligent.

| Use | Typeface | Character |
