## Part I -- Presentation: Rose OS Launch

> Rose Levels 1--3 & Aura Level 1
>
> Where Inner Awareness & Coherence become the source of leadership, creativity, sovereignty and joy.

### The Invitation

*"Insanity, as Einstein said, is expecting new results while repeating the same actions."*

We are building the future with inner tools from a world that no longer exists. Life now moves faster, louder, and more complex. We need inner tools that are simple, precise, and aligned with this moment.

**The Rose is an Alternative.**

### Welcome to the Rose

A Remembrance Ecosystem.

The Rose restores coherence across emotional, mental, and energetic systems, making intuition precise and presence sovereign. Simple and decentralized, it frees you from endless healing and returns you to natural alignment.

When coherence returns, Genius awakens. The Aura sharpens perception, revealing what shapes your choices, relationships, and reality.

### You Feel It

The Rose and the Aura cleanse your bodies, protect your energy, restore your clarity and return you to your essence.

Not techniques, but instruments of consciousness -- reminding you that you are the mountain, not the summit.

If life calls you into clarity, joy & presence, the way is open.

### Who This Is For

For those who feel the world accelerating and know the tools they inherited were not built for this moment. For founders, creators, parents, healers, and leaders who need clarity, intuition, and inner stability to move through complexity without losing themselves.

- **The Rose** awakens perception
- **The Aura** empowers leadership
- **Together**, they restore the inner coherence to create, love, and lead with confidence

### What the Rose Is

ROSE is simple, living inner technology:

- It restores awareness
- It restores coherence
- It restores real choice

It doesn't fight the noise and fragmentation. It quietly dissolves the conditions that keep chaos alive.

### The Two Questions

1. **Are you aware of your inner state at this moment?**
2. **Do you feel coherent inside -- if not, how can you restore it?**

No belief needed. Just an honest, inner awareness of your present state. When even a moment of coherence returns, clarity returns. When clarity returns, choice becomes real again.

### Your Path, Your Contribution

**Option 1 -- The Rose**

- Two immersive days, online
- Six hours per day, offered in two three-hour sessions

**Option 2 -- The Rose + Aura 1**

- Eleven immersive days
- Four hours per day, structured in four flexible blocks

### The Guardians

**Angelina Ataide** -- For over three decades, she has carried this lineage with unwavering devotion. Her presence opens a field of rare precision and depth, guiding thousands into clarity, safety, and sovereignty. She protects the essence of the Rose and reminds us that true mastery is lived, not taught.

**Diego Dosal** -- He bridges Spirit and structure with uncommon clarity and vision. After years exploring multiple energetic paths, he recognized the Rose and Aura as the most powerful, simple, and accessible technologies to awaken Genius.

**Dara Ayoub** -- Rooted in pathways of embodiment, presence, and self-knowledge, with over a decade of practice, she holds the human dimension of this work. She sustains programs, community, and structure with reverence, nurturing an environment where students feel held, guided, and safe.

**Peggy Mars** -- With two decades of practice, she sustains the pedagogical precision of the lineage. She upholds clarity, depth, and methodological integrity, ensuring the teachings remain accessible, grounded, and pure.

### Begin

The Rose is not a path you follow. It is a frequency you cultivate. No belief required. Only presence. Willingness to return to your essence. When you choose yourself, clarity returns. From clarity, life becomes creation, not reaction.

And so you remember who you are.

*Start Your Journey. Welcome home.*

## Part II -- The Technologies of Remembrance

> See the full document: **[Technologies of Remembrance](../technology/technologies-of-remembrance.md)**

The Technologies of Remembrance presents the philosophical case for why new inner technologies are needed in this era. It covers:

- **The Collapse of the Old Paradigms** -- Why past traditions, while powerful, were not designed for the speed and complexity of modern life
- **The Era of Acceleration** -- The need for technologies that are simple, precise, non-hierarchical, and scalable
- **The Next Great Revolution** -- A revolution of consciousness to match the velocity of technological acceleration
- **Introducing the Rose** -- An inner technology that restores sovereignty by returning awareness to its center
- **The Intelligence of Silence** -- Silence as the axis beneath all movement, and the Rose as the path back to it
- **A Living Technology of Coherence** -- How the Rose restores presence, power, and natural truth
