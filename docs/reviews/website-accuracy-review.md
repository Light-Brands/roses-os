# Website vs Source Document Accuracy Review

> Conceptual accuracy review comparing the website content against **The Codex** (`docs/foundation/the-codex.md`) and **Technologies of Remembrance** (`docs/technology/technologies-of-remembrance.md`).

---

## Scope

This review compares the **meaning and concepts** presented on the website against the source documents. It does not check for word-for-word matches but whether the website faithfully represents the ideas, frameworks, and intentions of the source material.

**Pages reviewed:** Home, The Rose, The Codex, Programs, Guardians, Invitation, Learn More
**Data reviewed:** `src/lib/data/mock-data.ts` (coherence domains, eleven capacities, architecture layers, lineage, path levels, brand quotes, messaging pillars, guardian bios)

## Critical Issues

### 1. The 13 Domains of Coherence are completely different

**Source (Codex, Section IV)** lists 13 functional domains of inner restoration -- these describe how the Rose removes interference and where coherence is restored in the human system:

| # | Source Domain |
|---|-------------|
| 1 | Vision and Inner Representation |
| 2 | Hemispheric Integration |
| 3 | Sustained Attention and Volition |
| 4 | Nervous System Regulation |
| 5 | Somatic and Emotional Release |
| 6 | Internal Sovereignty |
| 7 | Creative Imagination |
| 8 | Polarity Integration |
| 9 | Heart Coherence |
| 10 | Integrated Intelligence |
| 11 | Somatic Block Resolution |
| 12 | Neural Pattern Updating |
| 13 | Embodied Presence |

**Website** (`mock-data.ts`, displayed on The Codex page) lists 13 life-area categories:

| # | Website Domain |
|---|---------------|
| 1 | Physical Coherence |
| 2 | Emotional Coherence |
| 3 | Mental Coherence |
| 4 | Relational Coherence |
| 5 | Creative Coherence |
| 6 | Vocational Coherence |
| 7 | Financial Coherence |
| 8 | Sexual Coherence |
| 9 | Spiritual Coherence |
| 10 | Environmental Coherence |
| 11 | Ancestral Coherence |
| 12 | Temporal Coherence |
| 13 | Universal Coherence |

**Impact:** These are entirely different conceptualizations. The source describes neuroscience-adjacent, functional domains of *inner restoration*. The website presents life-category domains. None of the 13 website domains directly map to any of the 13 source domains.

**Recommendation:** Replace with the actual domains from Codex Section IV, or clearly label the current list as an editorial interpretation separate from the Codex.

---

### 2. The Eleven Capacities are completely different

**Source (Codex, Section X)** -- "The Eleven Capacities of the Remembered Harmonic Being" -- natural abilities that emerge spontaneously when coherence is restored:

| # | Source Capacity |
|---|----------------|
| 1 | Clear Seeing |
| 2 | Coherent Communication |
| 3 | Embodied Sensitivity |
| 4 | Direct Knowing |
| 5 | Directional Sense |
| 6 | Self-Regulation and Restoration |
| 7 | Inner Sovereignty |
| 8 | Creative Intelligence |
| 9 | Relational Coherence |
| 10 | Integrated Awareness |
| 11 | Grounded Unity |

**Website** (`mock-data.ts`, displayed on The Codex page):

| # | Website Capacity |
|---|-----------------|
| 1 | Stillness |
| 2 | Presence |
| 3 | Breath |
| 4 | Feeling |
| 5 | Listening |
| 6 | Discernment |
| 7 | Courage |
| 8 | Surrender |
| 9 | Integration |
| 10 | Service |
| 11 | Remembrance |

**Impact:** The source explicitly says these capacities "are not learned. They are remembered" and "naturally emerge when noise dissolves." The source describes advanced perceptual and relational capacities. The website describes foundational practice qualities one cultivates. These represent a fundamentally different level and type of capacity.

**Recommendation:** Replace with the actual capacities from Codex Section X.

---

### 3. Architecture Layers (Hardware/Software/Heartware/Soulware) are reinterpreted

**Source (Codex, Sections VII-VIII)** uses these as ecosystem/infrastructure layers:

| Layer | Source Meaning |
|-------|---------------|
| Hardware | Physical spaces -- sanctuaries, studios, developments (Alto Paraiso, Costa Rica) |
| Software | Digital platforms -- apps, protocols, governance, translation systems |
| Heartware | Community -- Rose Circles, Aura Circles, Dream Circles, transmissions |
| Soulware | Deepest spiritual architecture -- awakened through Rose, Aura, Dreams |

**Website** (`mock-data.ts`, displayed on The Codex page) reinterprets them as layers of the individual:

| Layer | Website Meaning |
|-------|----------------|
| Hardware | "The physical body: bones, muscles, organs, nervous system" |
| Software | "The mind: beliefs, patterns, conditioning, stories we carry" |
| Heartware | "The emotional and relational intelligence" |
| Soulware | "Essence, purpose, and the remembrance of who we truly are" |

**Impact:** The source's framework is organizational -- describing how ROSES OS is built and delivered to the world. The website turns it into a personal framework describing layers of an individual. This changes the meaning of a central architectural concept in the Codex.

**Recommendation:** Rewrite to reflect the ecosystem infrastructure meaning, or present both interpretations clearly.

## Moderate Issues

### 4. The Rose described as a "practice" -- source says it is not

- **Website** (The Rose page): "The Rose is a systematic practice rooted in imagination, awareness, and the cultivation of inner coherence."
- **Source** (Codex III): "An operating system is not a practice. It is what allows all practices to function coherently. Roses OS is not a meditation. It is the architecture through which remembrance becomes embodied."

The source draws a deliberate distinction between a practice and a technology/architecture. Calling it a "systematic practice" contradicts this.

**Recommendation:** Change to "living technology" or similar language consistent with the source.

---

### 5. The Rose attributed as "developed by" Angelina Ataíde

- **Website** (The Rose page): "Developed over decades by Angelina Ataíde and drawn from a deep lineage of consciousness research"
- **Source** (Codex II): "The Rose Meditation did not emerge from theory or invention. It was received through direct transmission." Angelina "has upheld and embodied the Rose as a living transmission."

"Developed" implies creation. The source says the Rose was received by Bostwick in the 1960s; Angelina is the current steward. Also, "consciousness research" reframes a spiritual lineage of transmission as something more academic.

**Recommendation:** Change to language reflecting that Angelina received, upheld, and stewards the lineage.

---

### 6. "Old Paradigm" section reframes the source's critique

- **Source** (Technologies of Remembrance): Critiques old spiritual, philosophical, and religious systems that hardened from living presence into dogma. Uses the Everest-with-1800s-equipment analogy.
- **Website** (The Rose page): "For decades, we have been told that more information would save us... The old paradigm was built on the assumption that we are broken and need fixing."

The source critiques ancient wisdom traditions losing their living essence. The website critiques modern information/productivity/self-help culture. These are different arguments.

**Recommendation:** Align with the source's framing (old wisdom traditions, not modern productivity culture) or acknowledge the editorial choice.

---

## Minor Issues

### 7. Coherence definition loses its dynamic quality

- **Source:** "Coherence is inner agreement... the practiced ability to notice the split and gently return yourself to agreement." Explicitly says it is "not something you possess."
- **Website** (The Codex page): "The state in which all dimensions of being move as one integrated field."

Framing it as a "state" loses the source's emphasis on coherence being an ongoing practice of return, not a static condition.

### 8. Lineage entry for Bostwick narrows his work

- **Source:** He "channeled and systematized the techniques and tools sent by the angels, to assist in the process of evolution of humanity."
- **Website:** "Channeled the material of Aura Reading in California."

This reduces his broader transmission to just "Aura Reading."

### 9. Anastasia Plunk dated to "1980s" -- not specified in source

The source says "the lineage was carried forward by Anastasia Plunk" without specifying a decade. The website assigns "1980s."

### 10. "50+ Countries" stat is unverified

The homepage shows "50+ Countries." The source docs mention international recognition but don't cite this number.

### 11. Core questions modified

- **Source** (Manifesto): "Are you aware of your inner state right now?" and "Are you internally coherent?"
- **Website** (Home): "Are you aware of your inner state at this moment?" and "Do you feel coherent inside? If not, how can you restore it?"

The second question adds a restoration component not in the source. The source emphasizes these questions "require no belief" and are "experiential and self-verifying."

### 12. Brand quote changes "consciousness" to "remembrance"

- **Source:** "The next great revolution will not be technological alone. It will be a revolution of consciousness."
- **Website:** "The next revolution is not technological. It is a revolution of remembrance."

Two changes: "consciousness" becomes "remembrance", and "not technological alone" (acknowledging technology's role) becomes "not technological" (dismissing it).

### 13. Angelina's bio undersells numbers and narrows scope

- **Source:** Initiated "more than six thousand individuals"; work includes "aura perception, conscious dreaming, and direct reconnection with the Rose."
- **Website:** "trained thousands of students"; described as "A pioneer in Aura Reading education."

"Thousands" undersells "more than six thousand." "Aura Reading education" is narrower than the source's description.

### 14. Rose hero uses "living practice" vs source's "living technology"

The source is precise about this distinction. "Practice" implies a method you do; "technology" implies an intelligence that operates through you.

## What the Website Gets Right

- **"A Seamless Path to Inner Freedom"** -- matches the Codex subtitle exactly
- **"Consciousness & Remembrance Ecosystem"** -- accurate framing
- **The Codex as "a living document"** -- matches source
- **Remembrance as returning, not learning** -- consistent throughout
- **Vertical/Horizontal axis governance** -- Diego's bio correctly references the horizontal axis
- **"Not a course. Not a cure. A way home."** -- well aligned
- **Non-hierarchical, decentralized, accessible design** -- matches source
- **Rose One offered freely** -- reflected in path levels
- **30+ years and 6,000+ initiated** -- stats on homepage are accurate
- **Overall tone and spirit** -- the reverent, non-dogmatic, invitation-based tone is consistent
