## Color System -- Rose Clay Mauve

### The Signature Color

The signature color of ROSES OS sits in a mauve-clay / mineral rose range.

**Rose Clay Mauve**

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| HEX | `#9C6F6E` (fluctuates between `#9A6B6A` and `#9E726F` depending on texture + light) |
| RGB | ~156, 111, 110 |
| HSL | warm, low saturation, mid-dark value |

This color reads as:

- **Earthy** (clay, mineral)
- **Human** (blood / warmth)
- **Calm** (low saturation)
- **Neutral-leaning** (not floral pink)

It is not feminine -- it is biological and geological.

### Where It Belongs in the Brand System

#### Primary Neutrals (Structural)

| Color | HEX |
|---|---|
| Aura White | `#F7F5F2` |
| Soft Charcoal | `#3F3E3C` |

#### Secondary

| Color | HEX |
|---|---|
| Rose Clay Mauve | `#9C6F6E` |

---

### How to Use Rose Clay Mauve

This color should never be used like an accent button color. It is a **field color**, not a highlight.

#### Correct Uses

- Full-bleed slide backgrounds
- Long-form reading sections
- Quote slides
- "What the Rose Is" / philosophical content
- Invitation pages
- Threshold moments

#### Avoid Using It For

- CTAs
- Small UI elements
- Icons
- Text highlights
- Navigation text

> Think of it as: **The room you enter -- not the object you click.**

---

### Typography Rules on Rose Clay Mauve

On Rose Clay Mauve backgrounds:

- **Headlines:** Aura White (`#F7F5F2`) or very light sand
- **Body text:** Neutral Sand (`#E4DED8`)
- **Bold emphasis:** Aura White only (no brighter contrast)

Avoid pure white -- it breaks the warmth.

---

### Texture Guidance

The success of this color is because of texture.

> Rose Clay Mauve should always be paired with subtle texture (linen, paper grain, soft mineral noise). Flat fills make it feel cosmetic. Texture makes it architectural.

This keeps it:

- grounded
- tactile
- non-glam
- non-beauty-brand

**Elegance vs Tech:**

- Inter + spacing + restraint = technology
- Cormorant + texture + clay = devotion
- This mauve-clay sits between them

This color becomes the **human interface layer** of ROSES OS. Alive. Calm. Intelligent.

> A warm mineral field color used for moments of reflection, invitation, and remembrance. It represents the human interface of ROSES OS -- where presence meets structure. This color should feel lived-in, not decorative. Always textured. Always quiet.

### Primary Background Color

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| HEX | `#7A3A34` to `#7F3F39` (screen variance) |
| RGB | ~122--127, 58--63, 52--57 |
| Hue | ~6--10 degrees (red--earth) |
| Saturation | low--moderate |
| Lightness | low--mid |

**How it feels:**

- **Material:** fired clay, iron-rich earth, terracotta tile
- **Temperature:** warm, grounded, weighty
- **Energy:** solid, embodied, ancient rather than romantic

**Why it reads differently than mauve:**

- Much less violet
- More iron / oxide than rose
- Feels architectural and elemental
