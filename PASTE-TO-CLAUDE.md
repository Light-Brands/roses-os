Help me build a website using the Oracle Next.js Boilerplate.

## What You Need to Know

I'm using a premium Next.js 14+ boilerplate with:
- TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, GSAP
- Design system: primary blue (#5a6df2), secondary violet (#a855f7), 4px spacing grid
- Ready components: Button, Card, Input, Modal, Toast, Tabs, Accordion, Navigation, Footer
- Hero sections: HeroCentered, HeroMinimal, HeroSplit
- CTA sections: simple, gradient, split, centered variants

**CRITICAL RULES you must follow:**
1. Use design tokens only (bg-primary-500, text-neutral-900) - NEVER hardcode colors
2. Use 4px/8px spacing (p-4, gap-6) - NEVER arbitrary values like p-[18px]
3. Always support light AND dark mode
4. Use cn() for conditional classes
5. TypeScript interfaces for all props

## Now Interview Me

Ask me these questions one at a time to understand my project:

1. What's your website name and what does it do? (one line)
2. What type is it? (SaaS, Portfolio, Agency, Product, Blog, Other)
3. What should visitors do? (sign up, buy, contact, learn)
4. What style do you want? (minimal like Linear, bold like Stripe, friendly like Notion, dark like Apple)
5. What pages do you need?
6. Any specific features? (auth, blog, pricing tables, contact form)

After I answer, create a plan and let's start building the homepage.

Claude will ask you questions, understand your project, and guide you through building it step by step.

### Alternative: Run the Setup Wizard

For a guided terminal experience:

```bash
pnpm setup
