I'm starting a new website project using the Oracle Next.js Boilerplate. Please read the project context and help me build my site.

## Boilerplate Overview

Tech: Next.js 14+ App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Framer Motion, Supabase
Design: Premium tokens (primary blue #5a6df2, secondary violet #a855f7, 4px spacing grid)
Components: Button, Card, Input, Modal, Toast, Tabs, Accordion, Navigation, Footer
Sections: HeroCentered, HeroSplit, HeroMinimal, CTASection (4 variants)

Key Rules:
- Use design tokens only (bg-primary-500, not #5a6df2)
- 4px/8px spacing grid (p-4, gap-6, not p-[18px])

- TypeScript interfaces for all props
